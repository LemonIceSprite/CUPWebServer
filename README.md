# CUPWebServer

It's a small websever write by C.
Now it developed to div-function pool version.
(single -> multi-process -> multi-thread 
        -> threadpool -> div-function pool)
it could help people to understand how a webserver works.(of course the easiest server)

with the test of http_load
now the best performance could reach 2800 fetches per second with the sample of 100,000 web pages.
